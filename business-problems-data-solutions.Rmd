I have chosen Delair as a company. Delair has created a Aerial Intelligence Cloud Platform. It's a Drone Data Analytics for Mines and Aggregates.

TO DO:
More clear explanation of steps. Use some of theory in provost H2 and use it to answer the questions

What are the three main things you learned here?
1. Difference between supervised, unsupervised learning and in video semi-supervised learning.
2. The different data formats used. XML vs JSON. the differences between both.
3. Use different methods. for example ECLIPSE to translate your a problem into a data mining problem.

What two things were interesting to you?
The amount a creativity that can be used in machine learning. from images to solve a problem.
I like to learn about how machine learning works. How i can prepare the data so I can use it to solve a problem.

Which item you learned are you planning to apply to your project?
I will use ECLIPSE for my current assignment.

## What was the business problem?

Improving the margin in mining industry. Margin in the mining industry are very thin. [Source](https://www.statista.com/statistics/208725/net-profit-margin-of-the-top-mining-companies/#:~:text=For%202019%2C%20it%20means%20that,every%20U.S.%20dollar%20they%20earned.&text=The%20average%20net%20profit%20margin%20of%20the%20world's%20top%2040,to%20nine%20percent%20in%202019.) In this source it states that for 2019, it means that the top 40 mining companies kept nine cents of profit out of every U.S. dollar they earned.



## How was it translated into a data mining problem?

Using the ECLIPSE model:

Mnemonic | Question                                                               | Answer
---------| -------------                                                          |-----------
E        | Expectation: Why does the user want the information?                   | Save money on accurate measurements, using the tools to optimize the design and equipement selection. safety and regulatory concerns
C        | Client Group: For whom is the service / product intended?              | Mining and raw material industry, preservation groups for the environment  
L        | Location: Where is the service / product sited?                        | On location used. By own trainer personal or hired operators.
I        | Impact: What would represent success? How is this measured?            | Improved bottomline, reduced down time machines. improved billing by accurate measurements.
P        | Professionals: Who provides or improves the service / product?         | Belair provides updates for drones and maintainence with a service level agreement. Also the infrastructure of the Business Intelligence Tools. 
SE       | Service: What type of service / product is under consideration?        | The results of the drone are used to measure , analyse the aerial footage. Based on the task multiple readings can be used to provide answers to business questions.

In order for Belair to improve the bottom line they introduce a complete drone based analytics solution to proces, view and share the drone surveys. These aerial data can be used to make calculations on expected volume of an area. Like a advanced volumetric toolset. all kinds of data is collected from the camera sensors in the drone. It gives the customers a wide arrange of tools.

## What is the realized business value?

aerial views for big industry in the raw meterials industry can benefit by using relatively cheap aerial survailance with advanced sensors to measure and prepare their best course of action. You can image when setting up a big mining machine (like in the image below)in the wrong area can result in down time for the machines. Also the use drone in comparison to conventional aerial mapping techniques (Satelites) is expected to be 50 time faster than. This gives great flexibility. 

Example of solutions given in the video:

1. Save money on accurate measurements, which results in better billing procedures. 
2. During development of a mining site using the tools to optimize the design and equipement selection.
3. Regarding safety and regulatory concerns. Used the aerial footage and measurements to inspect the width of the road and possible workflow bottlenecks regarding this.
