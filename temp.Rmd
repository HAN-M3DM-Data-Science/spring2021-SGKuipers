# Data driven business 

## What features define a data driven business?

Features of this data driven industry can be found in that they try to adapt to the changes of the consumer. They see changes in purchasing patterns. They see this as a reason to evolve their business as well. Changes in consumers purchasing patterns can be supported by a recent research report [Source](%5Bhttps://www.accenture.com/us-en/insights/consumer-goods-services/coronavirus-consumer-behavior-research) that focusses on COVID-19: How consumer behavior will be changed. The Image below feeds this narrative very well. 

In the interview they are understanding the value of information about their consumers.As well as the product to answer questions like. How well are products performing in term of sales? Where are these products being used. How are these products used? They do this to get a better understanding of the market place.

# Data Culture

## What are the important features of a data culture?

Data culture refers to a company's ability to use data to make decisions. Companies with a strong data culture consistently rely on data to inform their strategy [Source](%5Bhttps://www.millanchicago.com/resources/what-is-data-culture-and-why-do-you-need-it%5D). This research paper defines data culture as "a specific set of values, behaviours and norms that enables effective data analytics" [Source](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/336904583_Do_we_have_a_Data_Culture).

What are the values, behaviors and/or norms that we can find in the Amer Sports video.

## **Values:**
Use data to drive the decisions of the employees.

## **Behaviors:**
Changing the way of working.

Creating a transparent environment for the performance of all departments.

## **Norms:**
Using carefully selected KPI's to measure performance

## **Step 1) Business understanding**

Traditionally Amer Sports Sells directly Business to Business (B2B). 
Nowadays the changed it more to a Business to Consumer (B2C)
This transformation started by asking the question what and who are our costumers?

## **Step 2) Data understanding, 3)Data preparation and 4)Modelling**

Next step was to try and collect data via experiments by creating a dashboard for each department.

## **Step 5) Evaluation**

After feedback, optimize these dashboards going over each department.

## **Step 1) Business understanding **
They found out that each department had different data they wanted to see.

## **Step 6) Deployment**

The end result was that that use data driven advice to drive more sales to retailer.

To further improve this transformation they added some predictive analytics. For example the Sales department identify succesfull retailers and struggling retailer. This gave them the opportunity to be more proactive in their sales approach.

Future steps yet to be taken: Automate & Scale the Supply Chain.
